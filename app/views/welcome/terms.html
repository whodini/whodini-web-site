<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p>Last updated:  August 27th, 2013</p>

<p>
  These Terms of Service (“Terms“) govern your access to and use of Whodini (“Whodini”, “we” or “our”) websites, services, and applications (collectively the “Service“). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
</p>

<h2>Your Use of the Service</h2>
<p>
  By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization or entity (“Organization”), then you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that Organization and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” refers to you and that Organization.
You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Whodini, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. The Service may change from time to time as we evolve, refine or add more features to the Service, often without prior notice to you. In addition, Whodini may temporarily or permanently stop providing the Service, or any features within the Service, to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice.
</p>

<h2>Your Content</h2>

<p>Some areas of the Service allow you to post or upload information, text, graphics, or other material (“Content” or, when posted by you, “your Content”), and to share your Content with others. You retain ownership of your Content, but there are many things that users may do with your Content, for example, copy it, modify it, re-share it, or broadcast it. Whodini has no responsibility for that activity. You understand that publishing your Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization. Please consider carefully what you choose to share.</p>

<p>You agree not to post Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current. You agree that any Content that you post does not and will not violate rights of any kind, including without limitation any intellectual property rights or rights of privacy. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to reject and/or remove any Content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates these provisions.</p>

<p>You retain full ownership to your Content, but you agree to grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, perpetual, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, edit, translate, make derivatives, display and distribute such Content in connection with providing the Service to you and other users in accordance with your settings on the Service. In connection with providing the Service, we may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.</p>

<p>We reserve the right at all times, but are not obligated, to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Service including your Content. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Whodini, its users and the public.
Your Account</p>

<p>You must provide us accurate information when you create your Whodini account. Your Whodini account gives you access to the Services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of users or organizations. If you connect to Whodini with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service. You may never use another user’s account without permission.</p>

<h2>Account Security</h2>

<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with Whodini or a third-party service. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols with your account. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. Whodini cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements. You must notify Whodini immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code.

<p>In the unlikely event that Whodini has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Whodini claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in the city of Los Altos, California under the commercial rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Whodini from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Whodini’s proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WHODINI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</p>

<p>These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Whodini in connection with the Service, will constitute the entire agreement between you and Whodini concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>No waiver of any sections of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Whodini’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<p>We may provide notifications, whether these are required by law of are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by us in our sole discretion. You can opt out of certain types of notifications through your settings page.</p>
