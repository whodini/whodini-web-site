      p Workforce engagement is the intensity and quality of employeesâ€™ interaction with and about customers, products, projects and vendors. We invented a method to measure and quantify engagement. Individuals and businesses can measure and track interactions as well as predict and influence outcomes. We call this the Whodini score. It is a leading indicator of success, or failure.
